We are two software engineering students in the Start-Up nation.
We developed this application as part of our end-of-study project.
We used to get together with friends over the weekend, and play classic games with each other.
One day, a friend told us about a game called &quot;the Mexican Game&quot;, being a game that can be played by adults and children, using only a pair of dice and a cup. Even though the rules may seem complicated, we got hooked on the game right away, and we've been playing it for several years now.
In reality, this game is not available on any platform, so we decided to create it as an Android application.\n\n

We hope you have as much fun playing this game as we do. Enjoy!\n\n

If you want to send us your comments and impressions about the game, you can contact us via our emails:\n\n
